# Alloy Solidification Solver

We are interested in developing code that runs two models of dendrite growth into an undercooled melt, generating data linking four variables over a wide range of growth undercoolings and velocities:

    ΔT	Growth undercooling
    V	Tip velocity
    R	Tip radius
    C0	Bulk alloy composition

The LGK model considers dendrite growth into an undercooled melt at velocities where the solid-liquid interface remains at local equilibrium.

The LGK-BCT model considers dendrite growth into an undercooled melt at velocities where rapid solidification effects are significant, including a velocity dependent partition coefficient and velocity dependent liquidus slope.  

### The LGK model (1984)
[Lipton, J., Glicksman, M. E., & Kurz, W. (1984). Dendritic growth into undercooled alloy metals. Materials Science and Engineering, 65(1), 57–63.](https://doi.org/10.1016/0025-5416(84)90199-X)

$$ ∆T = \frac{L}{c_p} Iv_t + mC_0 \{ 1 - \frac{1}{(1-(1-k_0 )Iv_c)} \} + \frac{2Γ}{R} $$

$$ R = \frac {\frac{Γ}{σ^*}} {\frac{P_t L}{c_p} -\frac{P_c m C_0 (1-k_0 )}{1-(1-k_0 ) Iv_c}} $$

With the following identities

$P_t = \frac{VR}{2α}$ 

$P_c = \frac{VR}{2D}$

$Iv_t(P_t) = P_t e^{P_t} E_1(P_t)$

$Iv_c(P_c) = P_c e^{P_c} E_1(P_c)$

Where
- $P_t$       &nbsp; is the thermal Péclet number
- $P_c$       &nbsp; is the solutal Péclet number
- $Iv_c(P_c)$ &nbsp; is the solutal Ivantsov function
- $Iv_t(P_t)$ &nbsp; is the thermal Ivantsov function
- $E_1(x)$    &nbsp; is the first exponential integral of variable $x$

Within these equations, there are eight constant parameters, defined as follows:
- $L$ 	&nbsp; Latent heat of fusion - $J/kg$
- $c_p$ &nbsp; Specific heat capacity - $J/(kgK)$
- $m$ 	&nbsp; Equilibrium liquidus slope - $K/ wt.$%
- $k_0$	&nbsp; Partition coefficient - *unitless*
- $Γ$ 	&nbsp; Gibbs-Thomson coefficient - $Km$
- $D$ 	&nbsp; Solute diffusion coefficient - $m^2/s$
- $α$	&nbsp; Thermal diffusivity in the liquid - $m^2/s$
- $σ^*$	&nbsp; Stability constant - *unitless*

For Sn-Ag alloys, these parameters are
- $L$ = 	  61,810.62 $J/kg$
- $c_p$ =     249 $J/(kgK)$
- $m$ = 	  −3.14 $K/ wt.$%
- $k_0$ =	  0.0191
- $Γ$ = 	  8.54 * $10^8$ $Km$
- $D$ = 	  1.82 * $10^{–9}$ $m^2/s$
- $α$ =	      1.5 * $10^{–5}$ $m^2/s$
- $σ^*$ =	  $1/(4π^2)$

There are four variables, defined as follows:

- $C_0$ Bulk alloy composition - $wt.$%
- $∆T$ Undercooling - $K$
- $V$ Velocity - $m/s$
- $R$ Dendrite tip radius - $m$

Fixing two of these variables, the other two can be solved iteratively using a method such as a two-dimensional Newton scheme, also known as the Newton-Raphson method in two variables.

In the codes we have written in the past, the user defines fixed values for $C_0$ and $∆T$ and the values of the 8 constant parameters.  The code then uses the Newton-Raphson method in two variables to converge on the unique values of V and R that satisfy these two functions. For this, we need to get the LGK equations into a form equal to zero and define them as functions f1 and f2:

$$ f_1(V, R) = \frac{L}{c_p} Iv_t + mC_0 \{ 1 - \frac{1}{(1-(1-k_0 )Iv_c)} \} + \frac{2Γ}{R} -∆T = 0 $$

$$ f_2(V, R) = \frac {\frac{Γ}{σ^*}} {\frac{P_t L}{c_p} -\frac{P_c m C_0 (1-k_0 )}{1-(1-k_0 ) Iv_c}} - R = 0 $$

The Newton-Raphson scheme in two variables can be written in long form as:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} V_{n+1} \cr R_{n+1} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} V_n \cr R_n \end{bmatrix} - J^{-1}(V_n, R_n) \begin{bmatrix} f1(V_n, R_n) \cr f2(V_n, R_n) \end{bmatrix} $$

Where:
- n is the current step
- n+1 is the next step in the iteration
- $J$ is the Jacobian matrix:

$$ J= \begin{bmatrix} {\partial f_1}/{\partial V} & {\partial f_1}/{\partial R} \cr {\partial f_2}/{\partial V} & {\partial f_2}/{\partial R} \end{bmatrix} $$

To perform the Newton-Raphson method, we need a good initial guess or approximate solution to the values of $V_0$ and $R_0$, i.e. $V_n$ and $R_n$ when n=0.

This can be taken from the approximate analytical solution in Eq. 8.91 and 8.92 of the book ‘Solidification’ by Dantzig & Rappaz (1st Ed):

$$ R = 6.64π^2 Γ(-m(1-k_0 ))^{0.25} \frac{C_0^{0.25}}{ΔT^{1.25}} $$

$$ V = \frac{D} {5.51π^2 (-m(1-k_0 ))^{1.5}Γ} \frac{ΔT^{2.5}}{C_0^{1.5}} $$

This is only a good approximation when:
1. The undercooling is small
1. The dendrites are solutal

    - Specifically, you want to use your implementation of the LKT-BCT model to calculate R versus ΔT using the constants in their Table 1.  And then put your values for R versus ΔT into their Eq. 5 to plot out Δt_bu versus ΔT and see if you get their Figure 3.  Note in their Eq. 5 that, when they write R(ΔT)^3, I think they mean (R as a function of temperature) cubed…

### To Do
- Currently getting unreliable convergence
    - Write Catch2 unit tests for basic building blocks
    - Maybe play with adaptive / clamped updates
    - Hess / more sophisticated optimizer
    - Maybe try looking up different techniques
- Attempt to reproduce some LGK plots
- Add T dependant LGK model where diffusivity, liquidus temperature, partition coefficient, and liquidus slopes are fit polynomials. *must figure out how best to implement this*.
- Implement LKT-BCT model and reproduce published plots
- Fix README by moving model explanations into docs folder and adopting the summary, method, installation, usage, support, roadmap, and acknowledgment structure.
