# Chris Optimisation Project

We are interested in developing code that runs two models of dendrite growth into an undercooled melt, generating data linking four variables over a wide range of growth undercoolings and velocities:

    ΔT	Growth undercooling
    V	Tip velocity
    R	Tip radius
    C_0	Bulk alloy composition

The LGK model considers dendrite growth into an undercooled melt at velocities where the solid-liquid interface remains at local equilibrium.

The LGK-BCT model considers dendrite growth into an undercooled melt at velocities where rapid solidification effects are significant, including a velocity dependent partition coefficient and velocity dependent liquidus slope.  

*One further thing…. With the LGK model (the simpler one), it would be very useful if we could use values for k and m that are functions of temperature.  This means that we can use phase diagrams where the liquidus and solidus lines are not straight lines.  Perhaps it would be best if k(T) and m(T) could be entered using a polynomial of order 5.*

### The LGK model (1984)
[Lipton, J., Glicksman, M. E., & Kurz, W. (1984). Dendritic growth into undercooled alloy metals. Materials Science and Engineering, 65(1), 57–63.](https://doi.org/10.1016/0025-5416(84)90199-X)

$$ ∆T = \frac{L}{c_p} Iv_t + mC_0 \{ 1 - \frac{1}{(1-(1-k_0 )Iv_c)} \} + \frac{2Γ}{R} $$

$$ R = \frac {\frac{Γ}{σ^*}} {\frac{P_t L}{c_p} -\frac{P_c m C_0 (1-k_0 )}{1-(1-k_0 ) Iv_c}} $$

With the following identities

$P_t = \frac{VR}{2α}$ 

$P_c = \frac{VR}{2D}$

$Iv_t(P_t) = P_t e^{P_t} E_1(P_t)$

$Iv_p(P_c) = P_c e^{P_c} E_1(P_c)$

Where
- $P_t$       &nbsp; is the thermal Péclet number
- $P_c$       &nbsp; is the solutal Péclet number
- $Iv_p(P_c)$ &nbsp; is the solutal Ivantsov function
- $Iv_p(p_t)$ &nbsp; is the thermal Ivantsov function
- $E_1(x)$    &nbsp; is the first exponential integral of variable $x$

Within these equations, there are eight constant parameters, defined as follows:
- $L$ 	&nbsp; Latent heat of fusion - $J/kg$
- $c_p$ &nbsp; Specific heat capacity - $J/(kgK)$
- $m$ 	&nbsp; Equilibrium liquidus slope - $K/ wt.$%
- $k_0$	&nbsp; Partition coefficient - *unitless*
- $Γ$ 	&nbsp; Gibbs-Thomson coefficient - $Km$
- $D$ 	&nbsp; Solute diffusion coefficient - $m^2/s$
- $α$	&nbsp; Thermal diffusivity in the liquid - $m^2/s$
- $σ^*$	&nbsp; Stability constant - *unitless*

For Sn-Ag alloys, these parameters are
- $L$ = 	  61,810.62 $J/kg$
- $c_p$ =     249 $J/(kgK)$
- $m$ = 	  −3.14 $K/ wt.$%
- $k_0$ =	  0.0191
- $Γ$ = 	  8.54 * $10^8$ $Km$
- $D$ = 	  1.82 * $10^{–9}$ $m^2/s$
- $α$ =	      1.5 * $10^{–5}$ $m^2/s$
- $σ^*$ =	  $1/(4π^2)$

There are four variables, defined as follows:

- $C_0$ Bulk alloy composition - $wt.$%
- $∆T$ Undercooling - $K$
- $V$ Velocity - $m/s$
- $R$ Dendrite tip radius - $m$

Fixing two of these variables, the other two can be solved iteratively using a method such as a two-dimensional Newton scheme, also known as the Newton-Raphson method in two variables.

In the codes we have written in the past, the user defines fixed values for $C_0$ and $∆T$ and the values of the 8 constant parameters.  The code then uses the Newton-Raphson method in two variables to converge on the unique values of V and R that satisfy these two functions. For this, we need to get the LGK equations into a form equal to zero and define them as functions f1 and f2:

$$ f_1(V, R) = \frac{L}{c_p} Iv_t + mC_0 \{ 1 - \frac{1}{(1-(1-k_0 )Iv_c)} \} + \frac{2Γ}{R} -∆T = 0 $$

$$ f_2(V, R) = \frac {\frac{Γ}{σ^*}} {\frac{P_t L}{c_p} -\frac{P_c m C_0 (1-k_0 )}{1-(1-k_0 ) Iv_c}} - R = 0 $$

The Newton-Raphson scheme in two variables can be written in long form as:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} V_{n+1} \cr R_{n+1} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} V_n \cr R_n \end{bmatrix} - J^{-1}(V_n, R_n) \begin{bmatrix} f1(V_n, R_n) \cr f2(V_n, R_n) \end{bmatrix} $$

Where:
- n is the current step
- n+1 is the next step in the iteration
- $J$ is the Jacobian matrix:

$$ J= \begin{bmatrix} {\partial f_1}/{\partial V} & {\partial f_1}/{\partial R} \cr {\partial f_2}/{\partial V} & {\partial f_2}/{\partial R} \end{bmatrix} $$

It is convenient to write this in terms of the difference in the variables, $∆V$ and $∆R$

$∆V=V_{n+1}-V_n$

$∆R=R_{n+1}-R_n$

It is also convenient to have J on the left-hand side so we do not need to use its inverse.

$$ J(V_n, R_n) \begin{bmatrix} ∆V \cr ∆R \end{bmatrix} = - \begin{bmatrix} f_1(V_n, R_n) \cr f_2(V_n, R_n) \end{bmatrix} $$

Which can be written in shorthand as:

$$ J ∆ =- F $$

Therefore $∆$ can be solved with the function:

$$ ∆ = -J \backslash F $$

Where the backslash operator \ is the matrix left division operator.

Analytical solutions for the Jacobian partial differentials can be calculated using any given automatic differentiation tool. 

To perform the Newton-Raphson method, we need a good initial guess or approximate solution to the values of $V_0$ and $R_0$, i.e. $V_n$ and $R_n$ when n=0.

This can be taken from the approximate analytical solution in Eq. 8.91 and 8.92 of the book ‘Solidification’ by Dantzig & Rappaz (1st Ed):

$$ R = 6.64π^2 Γ(-m(1-k_0 ))^{0.25} \frac{C_0^{0.25}}{ΔT^{1.25}} $$

$$ V = \frac{D} {5.51π^2 (-m(1-k_0 ))^{1.5}Γ} \frac{ΔT^{2.5}}{C_0^{1.5}} $$

This is only a good approximation when:
1. The undercooling is small
1. The dendrites are solutal
